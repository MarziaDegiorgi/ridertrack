              <p id="decription-why">The aim of <b>RiderTrack</b> is to provide an user-friendly management service for outdoor sport events and, especially, to support multiple input forms of tracking sources, even ones not introduced yet.
                The project main goal is to <b>simplify the organization</b> behind an event and, at the same time, to <b>foster the participation</b> of the athletes to whichever kind of race they could be interested in joining. To reach this scope, a flexible and extensible system has been developed, with the aim of <b>integrating tracking data from multiple sources</b>. On one hand, the system guarantees a noteworthy savings for the event administrator, who wonâ€™t be forced anymore to provide necessarily a specific professional tracking device to each participant of the race, and on the other hand, it allows athletes owning whichever different tracking device to compete all together in the same race, each of them with their <b>already owned</b> gadget.
